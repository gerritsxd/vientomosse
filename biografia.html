        <h1>Meet Carla - The Dreamer, Artist, and Adventurer</h1>
        <img src="images/fotocara.jpg" alt="Carla painting outdoors" class="bio-image">
        <p>Hi! I'm Carla, known as vientomossebike on social media. I'm a passionate dreamer and artist, an adventure woman who wants to travel around the world working on a Big Dream. Painting and cycling and selling my works spontaneously at the moment, online or by order.</p>
        <p>It all started with a great little trip around Les Landes in France. In 2019 came my first big solo trip of 1,500 km across the entire coast of Portugal to Santiago and Muxia, Spain.</p>

        <p>Now I just finished the Pacific route through California, Highway 1 from San Francisco to San Diego 1,200 km.</p>
        <!-- Continue with other paragraphs -->
        
        <p>People tell me that I am brave, that I inspire and encourage others. I believe that is my mission through what I do, and I am grateful every day for it. Maybe you are too, and you just need to read something like this to not wait any longer and make your dream come true because with total confidence, I tell you, anything is possible.</p>
